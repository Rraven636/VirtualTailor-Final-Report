\chapter{Solution Design}

\section{Implementation Design}
1) Online profile of people - Used for online shopping and retail shops\\
2) Take measurements at a retailer - Virtual Dressing room - A part of the shopping experience and will reduce hassle of trying on clothes\\
3) Amount wasted in trying on clothes or online returns?\\
4) Could be used for personalised tailoring
5) Example of UI - Explanation of how it works

\section{Component Selection}
1) Choice of Kinect\\
2) Choice of Windows SDK\\

\section{Algorithm Design}
1) Windows examples used - Background Removal, Colour Stream and Skeleton Tracking - NB - Why BackgroundRemoval instead of own method
3D Points - No calibration

2) Run through of algorithm
- Background Removed frame
- Send image to separate class for processing
- Create array with background removed pixels
- Draw skeleton on image
- Create axes for measurement - Perpendicular or straight depending on particular measurement

\section{Experimental Design}
- Constraints - Men, distance from Kinect, Number of views, 3D Modelling
- UI to run simulated dressing room
- Volunteer to pose as instructed by person controlling UI
- Take measurement of front
- Take left
- Take back
- Take right 
- At each point, take actual readings with uncertainty
- Note: Did not use correction in \cite{nonContact2017}
- For one volunteer, take 5 readings in relatively the same pose - Determine uncertainty
