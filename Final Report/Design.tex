\chapter{Solution Design}
This chapter details and explains various aspects of the solution design. It begins with a explanation of the envisioned implementation of the solution in the clothing industry ecosystem. This is followed by a detailed account of the design process used to create the solution and lastly, an extensive overview of the experimental process used to test the solution.

\section{Implementation Design}

\subsection{Overview}
The solution aims to form part of larger practical implementation that will be applicable and provide relief in all three clothing channels mentioned in Section \ref{clothingIndustryContext}. However, in order to understand the needs the implementation must address, an analysis of pain points of consumers and producers in each channel must be performed. Shown in Table \ref{tab:conProdPainPoints} is a summary of such an analysis.

The aim of the overall implementation is to alleviate stresses on both consumers and suppliers that are inherent to the status quo.  In order to achieve this, the implementation will consist of the following key components: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item A compact, expedient and easy to use system that accurately measures the body parameters of a customer and provide clothing suggestions
	\item A platform that retains this customer information and creates a digital profile accessible to the customer and shareable between retailers  
	\item An intuitive interface that allows the customer to seamlessly get advise on clothing at his/her retailers of choice	
\end{itemize} 

These key components were developed into a more detailed end-to-end journey of the implementation. This is given in the following section.

\subsection{End-to-End Implementation Journey}
A diagram illustrating the high-level functioning of the entire implementation is seen in Figure \ref{fig:endToEndImplementation}.

	}}
	\caption{An illustration of the End-to-End journey of the envisioned implementation}
	\label{fig:endToEndImplementation}
\end{figure}

The implementation can be broken down into three major subsystems that are mentioned and explained in the following subsections:

\subsubsection{Measurement System} \label{measureSystem}
This system's main purpose is to be able to determine the personalised body parameters of a customer and then generate a full 3D model of their body to provide useful information such as suggestions for clothing sizes. It will achieve this by using a Kinect, or another device with depth sensing capabilities. 

The vision is that the Kinect would be integrated into a specially designed room. The customer would need to step into this room and hold certain poses. The Kinect, together with a back-end processing unit, would then create a full 3D. The entire process from start to finish should be less than ten minutes. 

This is the most integral part of the implementation as it allows for the realisation of the other two subsystems mentioned below. The main focus of this project is creating a first attempt at this subsystem. As such, its design and functioning are covered in great detail in Section \hl{(Measurement Design)}. 

\subsubsection{Store Integration}
In order to facilitate the measuring process, a room, integrated with a Kinect, would need to be placed at a convenient location for customers. Two possibilities are explored here:

\paragraph{Traditional Retailers}
There is a significant incentive for these retailers to provide a space for this "virtual room". (Expanded upon in Section \hl{(Benefits)}) As such, given that this system aims to limit the need for physically trying on clothes, one of the spaces previously dedicated to a dressing room could be upgraded to this new virtual room. Minimal change to the infrastructure would be required and this also frees up more space as unused dressing rooms can be replaced. 

In this instance, consumers would be able to record their measurements when visiting the clothing store. The measurements would be recorded and they can continue their clothing shopping with a better understanding of sizes. Since the customer would already be shopping and the process only needs to occur once (Assuming no change to the customer's body), it seems likely that their would be buy-in into the system.

\paragraph{Partners}
If there is enough interest by various companies, a measurement booth can be built in a commonly used location (I.e. in a shopping mall). Any customer visiting this booth, would automatically have profiles at all the companies sharing the booth. This is the other alternative if a specific company does not want to dedicate their floor space for this solution, but rather outsource it. This would also be the most likely method in which an online store can partake to allow for digital profiles of their shoppers to be created.

\subsubsection{Cloud Management of Profile}
Once the measurements of a person are determined and a digital profile is created, that information can now be more easily transferred. Partnerships may be made between clothing companies, online companies and even perhaps tailors. They may agree to share this information for an agreed upon amount and allow the costumer to have clothing suggestions for all the stores they shop at. Alternatively, a single online platform may be created that stores all these profiles and if a clothing supplier partners up with it, it can then provide information to the customers regarding the supplier's specific line of clothing.

\subsubsection{Potential Benefits}
The effective and practical implementation of the above system has significant potential benefits for each of the stakeholders. Table \ref{tab:conProdBenefits} contains a summary of the potential benefits for consumers and producers in the different channels.

\section{Component Level Design}
This section details the design process used to create the measurement system mentioned in Section \ref{measureSystem}. It first begins with the selection process used to choose both the hardware and software of the system. It then proceeds into the design of the algorithm, which forms the largest part of the design process.

\subsection{Component Selection}

\subsubsection{Hardware}

\paragraph{Depth Sensor}
When this project was first proposed, no hardware system was specified for use, However, it was indicated that a depth sensor should be the first technology explored to achieve this. Depth sensor technology has extensively been involved in projects performing analysis on human bodies. As such, this suggestion was used and a depth sensor was the hardware device chosen for the project. 

The next step was to determine the particular depth sensor used. Initially, due to ease of availability, sensors such as the Intel RealSense, Asus XtionPRO Live and the Kinect for Xbox 360 were considered. However, it was swiftly decided that the Kinect be the sensor of choice. The reasons for this are given below:

\begin{itemize}
	\item The Kinect has in built skeleton tracking functionality
	\item Microsoft has released an SDK (Software Development Kit) that allows for effective interfacing with the Kinect 
	\item Many previous research papers have utilised the Kinect and thus the support for it is extensive
	\item This project is for research purposes and there are no license conflicts with using the Kinect in this capacity
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Kinect Choice}
The next significant decision, however, was the version of Kinect used for the project. The first part of the process was the decision between the Kinect for Xbox 360 (Version 1 - v1) or the Kinect for Xbox One (Version 2 -v2). 

The Kinect v2 uses ToF (Time-of-Flight) technology that has been shown to improve its accuracy. It also does not falter as significantly as the Kinect v1 in extreme constitutions such as darkness or direct sunlight. It also has a better working range as the accuracy of the Kinect v1's depth sensor degrades exponentially as the distance away from the sensor increases whereas the Kinect v2 stays almost constant over the same range. \cite{kinectComp2011} This can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:kinectV1V2Depth}. 

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	{%
		\setlength{\fboxsep}{0pt}%
		\setlength{\fboxrule}{0.5pt}%
		\fbox{
			\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{kinectV1vsV2Depth.png}
	}}
	\caption{A graph showing the comparison of the accuracy and standard deviation of the Kinect v1 and Kinect v2 as distance from the sensor increases \cite{kinectComp2011}}
	\label{fig:kinectV1V2Depth}
\end{figure}

However, despite these performance advantages of the Kinect v2, the Kinect v1 was chosen for this project for the following reasons:

\begin{itemize}
	\item The Kinect v1 was already available for use and the Kinect v2 was not
	\item The tolerance advantage of the Kinect v2 to extreme condition is mitigated by:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The Kinect will perform in normal conditions - I.e. It will be indoors, in a well lit room with no direct light shining on the Kinect (Mentioned more in detail in \hl{(Experiment Design Ref)}).
		\item The Kinect v1 and v2 have very similar performance in normal conditions \cite{kinectComp2011}
	\end{itemize}
	\item Skeletal tracking only works effectively up to a distance of 3.5m. The difference in accuracy of the depth sensors only becomes significant after refore, the degradation of accuracy  of the 
	\item Many previous research papers have utilised the Kinect and thus the support for it is extensive
	\item This project is for research purposes and there are no license conflicts with using the Kinect in this capacity
\end{itemize}
